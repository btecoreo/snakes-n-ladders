There are two Players each starting at 0. They each take turns to throw a dice and toss a coin. The dice toss determines how many spaces they move. If they land heads they move forwards, tail backwards. You canâ€™t go past the final or starting square so if you throw higher or lower you stay where you are. After every go it will tell the player what square they got to, and the winner is the first on the last square.

Plan Step 1:

Initialise player class
Create a move function within player class
Return players end position
Step 2:

Create a loop that goes back and forth between players
Ask player to flip dice and coin and record their results
Step 3:

Structure game and UI
