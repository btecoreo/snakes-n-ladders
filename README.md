There are two Players, each starting at 0. They each take turns throwing a dice and tossing a coin. The dice toss determines how many spaces they move. If they land heads, they move forwards; tails backwards. You canâ€™t go past the final or starting square, so if you throw higher or lower, you stay where you are. After every go, it will tell the player which square they landed on, and the winner is the first one on the last square.

Plan Step 1:
Initialise player class
Create a move function within the player class
Return players' end position

Step 2:
Create a loop that goes back and forth between players
Ask the player to flip the dice and the coin, and record their results

Step 3:
Structure the game and UI
